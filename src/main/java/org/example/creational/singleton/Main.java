/**
 * The Singleton Design Pattern is one of the simplest and most commonly used creational design patterns. It ensures that a class has only one instance
 * and provides a global point of access to that instance. It is often used for logging, driver objects, caching, thread pools, database connections, and more.
 *
 * Intent:
 * The Singleton Pattern is used when you want to ensure that a class has only one instance, and you want to provide a global point
 * of access to that instance. This pattern can be helpful in scenarios where you need to manage shared resources or maintain a single point of control.
 *
 * Motivation:
 * The motivation behind the Singleton Pattern is to restrict the instantiation of a class to a single instance and provide a way for clients
 * to access that instance globally. By doing so, you can ensure that there's only one instance responsible for specific tasks or resource management.
